# Walkthrough — level00

## Goal

Obtain a shell with `level01` privileges and read the flag at `/home/users/level01/.pass`.

---

## Key lines (only the essentials)

These are the *single lines* from the program that matter for the exploit:

```c
scanf("%d", &password);
if (password == 0x149c)    /* 0x149c == 5276 (decimal) */
    system("/bin/sh");
```

---

## What they mean (plain explanation)

* `scanf("%d", &password);` — the program reads one integer from your input and stores it in `password`.
* `if (password == 0x149c)` — the program compares the integer you provided to a hardcoded value (`0x149c`, which is `5276` in decimal).
* `system("/bin/sh");` — if the comparison succeeds the program runs a shell. Because the binary is setuid/setgid to `level01`, that shell runs with `level01`’s privileges.

## Steps to get the shell and the flag

Interactive:

```bash
./level00
# when prompted "Password:" type: 5276
```

Non-interactive:

```bash
echo 5276 | ./level00
# or
printf "5276\n" | ./level00
```

Once you have the shell:

```bash
whoami        # -> level01
cat /home/users/level01/.pass
